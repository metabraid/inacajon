# Overview

INACAJON, which literally means "in a box", is a tool for Solution Architects and Engineers to design `Solution Building Blocks` using [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) Containers that manage `Container Objects` based on well-defined `IoC Lifecycles`

## Examples of IoC Containers and Lifecycles
* [iOS UISceneDelegate Protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate)
* [Android Acitivity Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle)
* [Spring Framework Web Application Context](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/WebApplicationContext.html)
* [Docker Build Image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
* [Docker Compose Containers](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)
